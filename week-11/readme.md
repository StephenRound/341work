#### Week 11

---

##### Paralaxadaisical

For this week, I knew it was going to be a lot to bite off with the turmoil of every other class going on. Instead of wrestling with my own construction of flexboxes along with this new hero image concept, I took the example code and played around with it. I also finally took the advice of checking the html file instead of pushing for each change. As such, this assignment will be within five pushes total, as opposed to the 30+ of previous weeks.

##### We've red this before

I'm sticking to red for my color scheme for this week. While my hero photo is more blue, I don't really have another good picture of myself (oddly enough). I played around with different font families and found the sans-serif ones to be a better choice for this assignment.


##### Real website

For another class, I've already built my own professional website (albeit with Squarespace, but... I've applied some knowledge from this class to it). I decided to have this site link to that site with its navigation options. Shameless plug! I may include this assignment as an easter egg on the main site.

##### Real Content

I'm truly planning on becoming a freelance artist, as you can tell by the true website. I used that for this assignment and plan on using it for the final. I've mused just recreating my Squarespace site, but that might be a little ambitious.
