#### Week 10

##### What is responsive web design?
This page, being meta, will describe RWD while also using it. The first element of the page that shall be seen is the header, which will be my face icon. The primary content of this page is the RWD discussion. Secondary content is all the other assignments I've done, available through the navigation bar.

##### Sketches

I might have just misinterpreted how to make these site sketches with flexboxes. At first I did literal sketches of a website for each type of device it would be viewed on, but now I've made simple mspaint sketches with actual flexboxes shown.
