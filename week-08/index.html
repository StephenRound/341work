    <h3>Snow</h3>
    <h5>By Stephen Round</h5>
    <hr />
    <p>
    A man breathed deeply. He could see the entire landscape before him from atop his perch at the peak of the world. Earthy tones were exemplified and deep green pines dotted the floor of the gorge. Clouds cast themselves in the way of the sun, creating a soft shade of grey across the sky. Few beams of sunlight shone through the cage of clouds. A light breeze tickled his face.
    </p>
    <p>The hike had been pretty successful, he thought. He had wished his wife and kids could have joined him. She was off on a business trip, as usual. The kids were staying with their grandparents, a boy aged five and a girl at three. His wife would argue that a hiking trip in the mountains was a little too dangerous for them, and after much consideration he decided the trip that would otherwise be an excellent bonding family moment would be a solo endeavor.
    </p>
    <p>
    The man plopped down on edge of the cliff, letting his feet dangle precariously over the edge. The cool breeze became subtly sharper; colder. His breath became visible. He reached back to his backpack and pulled off the canteen at the side, took a drink, and placed it back.
    </p>
    <p>
    The clouds thickened in both the sky and his mind. He became lost in thought, daydreaming, while staring into the infinite. His gaze fell down to his legs, standing on nothing, the tips of trees poking up below him like small green bristles. He had gone a ways up, he thought to himself. It was going to be a long way back down.
    <p>
    <p>
    The man sighed, becoming slightly discouraged at the hint of winter sneaking up on him. He had survived many a cold night before, sometimes even in the wilderness on occasions like this. It wasn't until the first snowflake crossed his vision that he made the decision to head back. He inched backwards away from the ledge and hoisted himself back up. The snow began to pick up, casting the scene before him in white.
    </p>
    <p>
    He turned back and started his way down the mountain. The path didn't seem immediately familiar to him. Trees seemed to twist in unorthodox ways, the rocks didn't appear to be there on the way up. Suddenly, he felt a sense of dread from choosing this mountain has a hiking destination for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
    The snow began to pick up. It was unusual, and the very least infuriating. The weather reports had no mention of snow, only rain clouds for a cool, overcast day. The man zipped his coat the rest of the way and braved onward.
    </p>
    <p>
    He hadn't come prepared for a harsh blizzard, so he hoped he would be able to make it to his jeep in time. Then would come the treacherous drive home down the winding mountain road. He had to make it, he thought. His legs began to pick up a faster pace, and in his hurried state he began to feel warm.
    </p>
    <p>
    "Shit!"
    </p>
    <p>
    A fallen log caught his foot. His attention went from getting back to his vehicle to the fast-approaching earth in an instant. His thoughts became preoccupied with self-cursing for letting himself slip on th-
    </p>
    <p>
    The ground met him, and gravity took hold as the weight of his backpack dragged him down the slope. He flipped over completely and began his spiraling descent down the slope of the mountain. The world churned and blurred past at nauseating speed, and he had no choice but to close his eyes and wait for it to end.
    </p>
    <p>
    Jagged rocks and twigs jabbed at him as he rolled past, clawing at his being. Snow dampened his coat as well as his spirits. All at once, the impromptu journey came to a complete halt as he crashed against a tree, lying haphazardly and sprawled on his side. The pain began to set in, sharply and rapidly. His arms screamed, his torso cried, and his legs cringed in pain. Snow peacefully continued to settle down, landing on his body as if he were any other natural formation, oblivious to his agony.
    </p>
    <p>
    The man breathed sporadically, bewildered by his fall. His eyes grew weary, and eventually closed in slumber. The winter covered him as quickly as it came.
    </p>

   The man's eye opened slightly, and he took a deep breath. The soft pillow under his head and warm blanket over his body provided a stark contrast to the situation he felt he was just in. His wife soundly slept next to him, a peaceful form tethering him further into the environment he was in. He was in his own bed in his own home.
   </p>
   <p>
   What the hell, the man thought. Wasn't I just in the mountains? The fall...
   </p>
   <p>
   He felt light-headed at the thought of the mountain trip, but he quickly realized it was a different time ago, a different life, a dream.
   </p>
   <p>
   Throwing his feet over the edge, he stood up. His toes felt cold, but not irritatingly so. As he strode across his room to the bathroom, he felt the hairs on the back of his neck rise as a slight chill ran down his spine. He shook it off and stretched, preparing for the day ahead.
   </p>
   <p>
   After spitting the toothpaste out of his mouth, he looked up at the mirror. His beard was scruffy, a jungle of hair concealing the lower half of his face. He thought he could see the tips of his beard hair slightly tinted white, but then his eyes fell on his reflection's, and he noticed his pupils seemed dilated. A light grey fog clouded his vision for a spell, and blinking repeatedly corrected his vision.
   </p>
   <p>
   The feeling lingered over him as he got dressed. His wife had gotten up, her beautiful brown hair clumped messily over her pristine face. He smiled at her as he felt another wave of blood leave his head, nearly causing him to collapse.
   </p>
   <p>
   "Are you alright?" she asked. Her eyes narrowed worriedly and started to move out of bed.
   </p>
   <p>
   "I'm fine, just a little li-ah, ah, ACHOO!" The man sniffed, the sneeze so forceful he became immediately sore.
   </p>
   <p>
   "I think you ought to stay home, honey. I'll call your boss," she walked towards the door and he slumped back in bed. His wife returned a few minutes later and laid her hand on his head. She uneasily moved her hand away.
   </p>
   <p>
   "You're... not burning up. You're freezing. Do you need more blankets?"
   </p>
   <p>
   "Yes, that'd be fin- ah, ACHOO!" he cursed as the sneeze had ruptured through his body. Pain grasped at him.
   </p>
   <p>
    "You've definitely caught something, dear. I'll come back for you after I drop off the kids."
  </p>
  <p>
    "Okay..." the man felt more miserable than sickness usually warranted.
  </p>
  <p>
    "I love you."
  </p>
  <p>
    "I love y-"
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
    "-ooou, too." the man relinquished the final breath of life he had, a chilly gust of air that carried the final thing he would have said to the love that wasn't there. His body has frozen, his face frosted, hypothermia set in. The icy claws of winter had crept into his body over the course of the night and claimed his life.
