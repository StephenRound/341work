### Week 09

##### A simple website

This week I chose to use my logo for my professional portfolio class. I thought I could give myself a challenge by replicating my sqaurespace website, but decided to only explore the things we've learned in this week.

##### A lot of divs

I definitely had to keep track of all my div elements and their classes to make this work. The navigation bar had a lot of trouble trying to be a navigation bar, but at some point I managed to get it just right.

##### Pastel reds

I like the color red. I chose a simple pastel red for the navigation bar. Like my website, the color scheme is white, red, and black. For this reason, I kept the text black on a white background.

##### Lorem Ipsum

I was spending too much time on the CSS and didn't want to make up content for an entire page. So, thankfully, Lorem Ipsum was there for me.
